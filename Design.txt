The basic game I created was a game of Unscramble-a-word. A user recieves a target
word and has a limited number of attempts to guess the target word. The first 
issue I ran into was how to implement the words, I decided words should be a full 
fledged entity, that way as I further development additional features and 
properties could be set in e.g. users create words for other users, no user can play 
own word. I added a Wins property to the User model to help keep track of rankings, 
and a recieves_updates boolean if the user chooses to opt out of emails. As for 
the Game model, I added a Moves property. The Moves property tracks the moves and winning/losing
move in a list for easy access. I found it a bit of a challenge to decide how words
could be stored and scrambled in the datastore, as well as how move tracking could be 
achieved.
